# 01 Creating Modules

# A module is a file.py
# We should separete our code in modules like products in a supermarket. Like a sections grouping products
# In this example for the following functions "cal_tax()" and "calc_shipping()" that are related with sales we should create a module with the name "sales.py" for example.
# The module name should follow the same conventions as naming variable or functions. Lower case letters and words separatd with underscore.

# def cal_tax():
#     pass


# def calc_shipping():
#     pass


# To import functions from one module we can use two ways.

from sales import calc_tax, calc_shipping # In here we select the module and then separated by comma each of the functions.

# Some tutorials teach to import multiple functions using an "*" "from sales import *".
from sales import *  # This is a bad practice because if we import everything blinding, some of our functions or variables in our "sales.py" module may override some objects with the same name in the current module.

calc_tax() # And the we can call each of the imported function in our new file
calc_shipping()

import sales # This is the second way to import a module
# In this way now in the curent module we have an object called sales, and we can use the "." operator to access the functions.

sales.calc_tax()
sales.calc_shipping()
